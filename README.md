**EEG Alzheimer's Detection Using LLM and ML Classifier**

This project is designed to analyze EEG data and predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease using a combination of a Large Language Model (LLM) and a Machine Learning (ML) classifier. The tool provides an interface for uploading EEG data and receiving diagnostic predictions.

**Features**

**EEG Data Upload:** Easily upload EEG files for analysis.

**Integrated Analysis:** Utilizes both LLM and ML models to enhance prediction accuracy.

**User Interface:** Built with the "gradio" package for a seamless user experience.

**Integration with OpenAI and NVIDIA:** This project utilizes NVIDIA's Palmyra-Med-70B-32K API in collaboration with OpenAI's advanced language models to enhance the analysis and prediction capabilities of the system.
